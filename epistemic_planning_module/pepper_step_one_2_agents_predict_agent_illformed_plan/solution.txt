(pickupblock_b_b1_bx1_p1)

Pepper predicts that agent b will try to pick up the block from box 1 

after performing this action, we get the following state. Note that in this state the goal (holding b b1) does not hold from Pepper's perspective (it does not appear in the state, so it is false. if we run the valid_assessment with (holding b b1), we get Goal holds: False). This is therefore a discrepancy between Pepper's beliefs about the validity of the plan and its beliefs about agent b's beliefs about the validity of the plan.
